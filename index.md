**Neural Machine Translation:** An NMT system which translates texts from Spanish to English using a Bidirectional LSTM encoder for the source sentence and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder with multiplicative attention for the target sentence ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Solutions/tree/master/assignments/)).

**Dependency Parsing:** A Neural Transition-Based Dependency Parsing system with one-layer MLP ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Assignments/tree/master/assignments/a3)). -->
