  I am a Data Scientist with industry and research experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Social Network Analysis, and Graph Neural Networks. I recently graduated from Boise State University with a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science (Spring 2022) where I was a part of the AIBS lab. My advisor was Dr. Francesca Spezzano. My dissertation is on characterization and mitigation of false information on the web, where first I analyzed the reason behind the success of the motive of false information, second, recognize and quantify the impacts made on information systems, and third, develop novel ways of identifying false information and the actors responsible for creating and spreading them. The main goal of my dissertation is to proactively combat false information by advancing towards the knowledge and understanding of false information and possible mitigation strategies. Over the course of my Ph.D. research, I got hands-on experience working with social media data from Twitter, online forums, and review-based platforms like Yelp and Amazon for understanding the actors responsible for misinformation creation, spread, and the victims of such false information. I have been working to address challenging issues such as, profiling fake news spreaders on Twitter using userâ€™s personality and psycholinguistic properties, understanding the factors that influence humans when assessing the reliability of the information, and identifying trustworthy entities in the information ecosystem both in social media and review based platforms and also quantifying the impacts of misinformation in recommender systems.

  In addition, I have also worked as a Machine Learning Intern at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) working on result reproduction and error analysis of state-of-the-art systems in named entity recognition. I also worked as Intern Data Scientist here at The Climate Corporation where I worked on a project to benchmark machine Learning models including statistical to neural network models for yield prediction.
